# Lyrics Corpora

There is a documents folder which describes the structure and management

## This will be updated later on.

To my knowledge there exists no similar if you take out the question of a google search "[name_of_the_song] lyrics"

[Example](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=remember+the+name+lyrics)

Why? I'll add one crucial thing: highlighting and seeing similar songs.
Right now you can do [this too](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=back+when+mark+walberg+was+lyrics)
But there is no highlighting and similar songs! 

## Installation
Will be added later.
You will be needing python 3.6 and git installed!
```
git clone https://github.com/avhalo/lyrco.git
python main.py
```

### Requirements
Will bea added later. Install pip3 or pip
```

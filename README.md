# Lyrics Corpora

There is a documents folder which describes the structure and management

## This will be updated later on.

To my knowledge there exists no similar if you take out the question of a google search "[name_of_the_song] lyrics"

[Example](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=remember+the+name+lyrics)

Why? I'll add one crucial thing: highlighting and seeing similar songs.
Right now you can do [this too](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=back+when+mark+walberg+was+lyrics)
But there is no highlighting and similar songs! 

## Installation
Will be added later.
You will be needing python 3.6 and git installed!
```
git clone https://github.com/avhalo/lyrco.git
cd lyrco
python ./main.py [args]
```

### Requirements
Will bea added later. Install pip3 or pip
```
pip install [stuff]
```

### Pull requests:

Option 1: https://github.com/avhalo/lyrco/pulls
Option 2: Do your own branch and I'll check it. Post it [here](https://github.com/avhalo/lyrco/issues)

*ALL REQUESTS ARE WELCOME* Especielly one with better optimization, better styling code (_under debate_), and better structure. Even typofixes are welcome. If you spot an error: report it.


### Future:
Use ML to do stuff. One thing I can think of is to set the lyrics in a NLP based DL library (TF ofc) and set the syllables as a paremeter (wiktionary helps) and creat rap-eti-rap song or other random lyrics. If it really works (it won't) I'll make it genre-specific (hardcore indie) and term-specific (love songs, songs mentioning "bitch"). Shits complicated. And I am not a ml engineer.

More simple would be to link to a youtube-video (will be proably done via search). The name of the songs will be mentioned. However. For now it will be a terminal based so I am thinking wheter there will be links to specific artists and their songs. Could see that happening. Would need to modify some parts. Will edit this later if this feature will be impelemnted.

[tests]
johny comes marching home
"We all feel gay"

johny I hardly knew ye
"doleful damsel"

atmosphere better day
"he must think I'm a fool"

drug ballad
"This is how we used to make the party start"

shakira whenever wherever
"I'll be there and you'll be near"

Concrete Schoolyard
"The contribution is clear"


"he writes every line"

"where do the children play"

"tämä harvoille luetaan"

"ja pahimpia on"

"plus four pennies"
